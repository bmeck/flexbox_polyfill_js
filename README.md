This was just for the fun of it on a Sunday afternoon. 

What this does:

Version 0.1:
takes a div #parent_div and gives it the flexbox model. takes in fixed-width children .fixed_width and flex-width children 
.flex_width. respects padding on #parent_div, and margin-left and margin-right on children. splits the remaining space left
after fixed-width children and margin and parent padding and divides it between the flex-width children.
